/*
 * TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) scheduling for ESB radio.
 *
 * Uses a short repeating frame to give each tracker a micro-slot for
 * high-frequency continuous packet transmission.
 *
 * Time base: server time ticks (32768 Hz) from PING/PONG synchronization.
 *
 * Frame structure (repeats every frame_ticks):
 *   [Slot 0][Slot 1][Slot 2]...[Slot N-1]   (N = total_slots, dynamic)
 *
 * Every slot is 22 network ticks. Normal NoACK traffic may use the owner's
 * slot once per frame. Approximately once per second, each tracker has a
 * deterministic guarded PING window spanning its slot and the following slot;
 * the following owner remains silent for that frame. Empty opportunities do
 * not cause transmissions.
 *
 * Parameters are dynamically assigned by NORMAL PONG bytes 8-11:
 *   byte 8:  assigned slot_index (0-15), or 0xFF when unassigned
 *   byte 9:  total_slots (0-16); a usable slot must be below total
 *   byte 10: slot_ticks (22 for the measured-safe nRF52 guarded mode)
 *   byte 11: config_epoch (wrapping uint8_t)
 * This legacy layout is unchanged. The separately requested CHANNEL_CONFIRM
 * PONG (0x37) carries channel proof, not TDMA parameters.
 * PONG remains 13 bytes with CRC at byte 12; other command layouts are unchanged.
 *
 * Normal NoACK traffic is limited to one packet per tracker frame. Before
 * queueing, payload-aware admission reserves measured READY->END airtime plus
 * queue/ramp margin; late packets wait for the next unguarded own slot.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   - Connection thread prepares packets and calls esb_write()
 *   - Every tracker derives the same PING/guard schedule from server frame time
 *   - A synchronized PING consumes its own frame and the next physical slot
 *   - Unsynced, stale-sync, or unconfigured PINGs transmit immediately for recovery
